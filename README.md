# Lang-by-example
I will store all basic examples of lang features which I often use.  
it's something like [learnXinYminutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/), but with more complex examples like rest or a detailed analysis of the type system features.  
I prefer less well-known languages.   
If you want to add your language, feel free to do PR ^^

Languages:  
* Nim
* F# WIP  
* Typescript
