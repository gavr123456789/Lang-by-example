# Lang-by-example
I will store all basic examples of lang features which I often use.  
it's something like [learnXinYminutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/), but with more complex examples like rest or a detailed analysis of the type system features.  
I prefer less well-known languages.   
If you want to add your language, feel free to do PR ^^


# Basic
My new idea to make the same 13 examples in each language, they will be located in the `basic` folder  

0) create and run project with cli if possible
1) type declaration person
2) tagged union declaration if possible
3) hello world
4) creating type instance
5) call function
6) change instance field
7) create function for type
8) loop
9) if
10) switch/pm (on tagged union if possible)
11) array/list/both
12) hash вщтуmap
13) import from other file
